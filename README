Study the impact of vibrational excitation on dissociative chemisorption of H2 and CH4 on Ni surfaces.

LAMMPS and PLUMED inputs are provided. The <mol>-base dirs contain sample inputs needed to 
(1) sample the probability distribution p(u) of a mode of interest at high Tvib and 
(2) parametrize a bias potential V(u) that enforces p(u) at a low gas temperature Tbg.
The <mol>-diss dirs contain sample inputs to calculate a free energy surface for dissociative 
chemisorption of each mol/surface combination. Note that the precise definition of the reaction 
coordinate \chi is slightly different in each situation. For reactions @ Ni(111), also inputs 
showing how to apply each V(u) are provided.

Any files that may be missing to run LAMMPS should be provided in the data/ dir.
